Hi, I'm Tintti.

I just finished my bachelor's degree in computer science and I'm working in my first full-time job as a software developer. I'm constantly learning new things but I sometimes have a hard time realizing all the things I learn. I've been thinking about keeping a learning journal or starting a blog for that for some time now, so here we are!

I've always found writing really stressful. Writing my Bachelor's thesis last year was pretty difficult because of that, so I thought maybe before the Master's thesis I should practice writing and having people read my writings.

So this blog serves a dual purpose; it's a learning journal that helps me internalize the things I learn - both at the university and at work - and hopefully it gets me used to the idea of someone reading the things I write.

To make starting this thing easy I went with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and its default theme (which is actually pretty nice!), hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I might play around with the theme still, but first I just want to get started.
