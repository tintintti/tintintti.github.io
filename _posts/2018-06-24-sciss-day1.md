title: SICSS - day 1 (and a bit of day 2)
---
I'm attending the Helsinki satellite event of [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/helsinki) 17.-30.7. The first week was spent in Tvärminne Zoological Station near Hanko. The program consists of local lectures and group projects, and of streamed lectures from Duke University, where the main event is held. I'm super excited about the whole program, even though I'm also a bit anxious about having the least experience out of anyone here, since I'm just starting my Master's studies.

Anyone can watch the [live streams/recordings from Duke University](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/live-stream) and most of the [materials can also be found from their website](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/#schedule).

The first day was long but really nice. We left Helsinki at 9:30 in the morning and arrived at Tvärminne after eleven. There were a lot of discussions and lectures, so I'm probably forgetting some things, but here are some of my thought of the first (and a bit of the second) day!

## What is computational social science?

After arriving we had lunch and then started the program around one o'clock with an introductions round and then a sort-of-a panel discussion about what computational social science is.

"Anything that's cool", was Matthew Salganik's first answer later when we were watching the stream from Duke. We were somewhat on the same page, as eventually we went with not defining it specifically. We also talked about big data, what it is and is it required for computational social science (no, but is "required" for getting funding, being a trendy topic at the moment). We also talked about whether there should be actually computational social scientists, so to speak, or whether social scientists and data scientists should just co-operate more. The consensus was pretty much that we need to co-operate, but we also need to have some knowledge about social sciences as data scientists, and vice versa.

Salganik's lecture ([slides found here](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2018/materials/day1-intro-ethics/02-intro-computational-social-science.pdf)) also went a bit deeper into what computational social science is than "anything that's cool". As an example he showed an article: [Predicting poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aac4420). They combined mobile phone metadata with a smaller survey and then predicted the wealth of people based on their mobile phone metadata in Rwanda. The predictions fared reasonably well when compared to government survey data. The method was also ten times faster and fifty times cheaper than the government survey. This could mean data could be collected more often than with the slower and more expensive method. Salganik stresses that even though its more expensive, the government survey is more reliable, because it has theoretical guarantees and there is a lot of experience of doing them.

Computational social science combines data that is available, like the phone records in the above case, and custom data, like surveys. There are also new ethical questions to be considered in computational social science, like privacy issues. We had a lecture and a group assignment on ethics, spanning the end of the first day and the start of the second day.

## Ethics

Instead of a video stream from  Duke, we had our own lecture (by Matti Nelimarkka, who's organizing the local Helsinki SICSS) about ethics, with a European perspective. We discussed the different approaches to ethics and univerities' ethical boards in the different countries the participants were from. For example here in Finland, research ethics is considered by the researcher and they decide whether there are issues that need addressing by the ethical board. We talked about cases where researchers had published data from OkCupid users, and Facebook manipulating users for emotional responses. This being Europe, we of course had to talk about GDPR too, though we didn't go too much into it. Research is exempt from many of the restrictions of GDPR, but the whole thing so new and complicated that it's maybe best to just consult a lawyer.

For our group exercise regarding ethics we had two case studies. [The first one](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2018/materials/day1-intro-ethics/ethics_activity.pdf) was a study where the researchers had sent different kinds of letters to people, trying to influence them to vote. One type of the letters said that they would tell your neighbors whether you voted or not, and had a list showing whether you and your neighbors voted in the last elections. This information can be found in public records, but we still felt that it was not ethical to pressure people into voting by trying to shame them in their neighbors' eyes. There was also an issue with the researchers not having their contact details or university mentioned in the letter, but only some consulting company, which had designed and administered the letters. After the group discussions we also had a debate on the subject between two of the groups.

[The second case](https://bdes.datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Patreon-Case-Study.pdf) was about using data published by hackers in research. A group of researchers was studying crowd funding using data from scraped from Patreon, a crowd funding website. Hackers published a data dump of all the information on Patreon, including private messages, and the researchers were debating whether or not they could use the data from the dump. They would only need the public data, but the question was would it be okay to use the data or was it tainted by the illegal means it was collected and the private data that the researchers might see when cleaning the data. We had a bit more diverse discussion no the second case than the first, since we also ventured into discussing whistleblowers and leaking government data. The problem with the Patreon data set - I think - was not as much the illegal way the data was published, but the risk of the researchers also accessing the private data.

The last lecture was a stream from Duke University, also by Matthew Salganik, and it was called Four areas of difficulty: informed consent, informational risk, privacy, and making decisions in the face of uncertainty. This was after dinner and I hadn't had coffee, so I have to confess my ability to concentrate wasn't the best. The first day was pretty theory- and lecture-heavy, but the rest of the weeks we had a lot more group exercises, which was nice.
